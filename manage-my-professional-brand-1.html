<p>And then we're gonna talk about achievements. At the end of the day are the proof that you've got abilities and we feel strongly that abilities are the currency of careers. We get hired for our abilities. And achievements is how we prove we've got those abilities. Then there's your blurb.</p>

<p>Your blurb is your pitch. What is your concise way of talking about who you are and what you want to do then LinkedIn, probably the most powerful career building tool out there and talking about how to manage that online presence. And then we'll wrap up with a summary on how we think about managing your brand more broadly and maybe some of the other things you can do outside of teal.</p>

<p>So with that, let's go ahead and get started. In this section, we're gonna talk about Teal's approach to building and managing your personal brand. And the way we define personal brand is it's the perception of an individual based on their experience skills and achievement within a career field, or industry.</p>

<p>And this is your brand. Think about brands like comp the way companies have brands, right? It's what people say about us when we're not there, that person was great to work with. That person builds great teams. That person is highly operational. That person's a great ideas person.  and they've done a lot.</p>

<p>And so that's what we wanna start to think about. And it doesn't happen automatically. It happens by what we put out there and we can take an active role in shaping that brand. And when it comes to your career and your identity and how people talk about you, it's really important that you be proactive in your approach to doing that.</p>

<p>And core to that is how you see yourself.  and then how others see you, that intersection of those two things is your personal brand and the closer you can bring them together, the better, right? What are people saying about you out in the market? How are people sharing the content you're producing? How are people passing along your resume?</p>

<p>How are people making introductions? That is all part of your personal brand. And we really want to focus on the way you curate that and that you get the most out. And so we see there being three core components that we're gonna cover in this class on how to curate and manage your personal brand. It's your achievements and the things you've done and how you articulate them in a way that provide proof that you've done them.</p>

<p>Then your pitch, your blurb, right? Oftentimes when you're gonna ask for an introduction or make a reference or a referral, it's what people are gonna see. It's your elevator pitch for yourself. And that shows up in your LinkedIn, it shows up in your resume. It shows up when you email it to somebody. So we really wanna get that tight.</p>

<p>And then your LinkedIn profile, like we said, is one of the most important things in building out your personal brand and your career identity. So we're gonna go deep on some of the things that you should think about as you're building out your LinkedIn profile. So with that, we'll jump into the next section.</p>

<p>In this section, we're gonna talk about achievements and achievements are proof that you've got an. And abilities are the currency of careers. At the end of the day, we get hired for our abilities, maybe who we know got us there, but what we know keeps us there. So it's really important that we focus on achievements and we continually document them in the way that prove what we know how to do.</p>

<p>So let's go ahead and dive in. An achievement is empirical proof that shows you have an ability. Again, it's really important that we think about that. It's empirical proof that shows you have an ability, right? Cause oftentimes it's your word against there. So you need to make a convincing case that you know how to do these things that you are saying, how to do, and achievements are the way to do that.</p>

<p>Most people forget to re include results in their LinkedIn profile and their career materials. Resumes oftentimes are very descriptive or done in narrative form and we need the results. We need to show the impact of our work. On the business. How did the company grow? How did the company prosper?</p>

<p>How did the company do better as a result of the work that we did, and we need to show that empirically. And so it's really important that we think about the results. And a lot of times we'll hear people say the work I did, wasn't measurable. Everything is measurable. Now that said not everything needs to be talked about in a measurable way, but everything's measurable.</p>

<p>And even. The act of showing that you were able to talk about it in empirical ways helps you stand out from the crowd. Cuz most people will just default to saying, ah, it's not measurable and then they won't do it, but it can be done. And it shows that you think in a business centric way when you're able to do it, here's an example of what not to do and what you'll see oftentimes on resumes or when people describe their work, worked with the tech team to increase web traffic.</p>

<p>Okay. What was your involvement in it? What did you do? How much did you increase it? Was it nominal? Was it pretty big? And it just doesn't say much in it. It just a lazy way to talk about it where it's just not gonna work. No, one's gonna believe you did it. Anyone can say this it's incredibly generic.</p>

<p>Now, what if you include measurable metrics and you talk about the results, so you can talk about the value that you brought to the business. So something like that could say grew engagement by 200%, which led to double the revenue in three months. Okay. I wanna hire that person. That is a person that knows how to think about engagement.</p>

<p>They know what part of the website traffic mattered. And they had a clear understanding of what the outcome was to the business and what they were working towards. This person lines up goals, achieves them and can talk about them in an empirical way and their impact to the business. That's what we're talking about.</p>

<p>When we talk about achievements and proof that you've done this and that you've got these abilities, this person knows how to manage engagement. This person knows how to think about revenue. This person helps the business do better. Therefore, I want them in the company and they're gonna grow within this company.</p>

<p>And there's a simple formula. There's a lot of different formats out there. And you don't need to stick semantically too, purely to this formula, but the idea is that you want that success verb. You don't want just generic verbs that don't say anything like managed or was part of, what did you do?</p>

<p>You increased it, you grew it, you reduced expenses. What was that active success verb then? What was the thing? The noun that you affect?  what was the metric that you were measuring and then what was that outcome? And you wanna make sure that you include these in your achievements. So what that could look like when we go back to the achievement that we used before grew, that's our success verb engagement.</p>

<p>That's what we were working on. The what? Buy metric 200%. That's substantial. Now you wanna be thoughtful about your metrics. We'll talk about that in a little bit, but you can frame metrics in a different way. So going from one to three is 200% grew up by two. Not that impressive. So you wanna be thoughtful in your storytelling and how you use the right metrics that paint the best light, which then led to double the revenue in three months, right?</p>

<p>That's the outcome that's impress. What was the outcome and in what time it wasn't indefinite. I read this and I say, okay, this person understood what they were doing. This is a clear and concise achievement. This feels to me like they really did this. This gives me proof that they did this. This gives me confidence to hire this.</p>

<p>I am. De-risking the hiring of me by speaking confidently and empirically about the things I've done. And that's what you wanna do. You wanna get into the mind of thinking? I need to convince people that I've done this. They're not just gonna trust me or believe me because I'm kind or I deliver it.</p>

<p>I need to give them proof. And so when you talk about your achievements this way, it helps build the proof that you've got these a. So why to include metrics because they help you build that proof. I just cannot stress it enough. The purpose of including metrics is to build proof that you have those abilities.</p>

<p>We also remember numbers better. Those things are the things that stick with us. And that's why you see numbers used so much they're impactful. But at the end of the day, the why is because we wanna build proof and we wanna be Memor. So here's some examples, right? Oftentimes we'll hear my category of work was not measurable and I don't know how to talk about it.</p>

<p>So here's some examples you can look at, say you're an event planner, you organized and sold out a charity event for 300 people and raised half a million dollars. Okay. That's substantial. If I was hiring for someone to run events, especially if it had to do with fund. That is relevant to me. I will then bridge the gaps on all the things that you needed to do to be able to achieve that.</p>

<p>I will then start TOFI your skills and abilities because you're showing me the outcome, right? How about someone who's in marketing, producing email campaigns, and a generic one might be manage the email newsletter for my. Okay what does that tell me? How impactful are you at it?</p>

<p>How good are you at it? I produced 90 emails, campaigns that generated over 2 million new subscribers within three months. Okay. I want that person on my team. They're thinking about how to do this work and they've proven that they've done it before now. That's a  meaningful conversation I can have in an interview.</p>

<p>Tell me about that time you did this and how did you do this? This excites me. This gets me curious.  okay. Something that's more internal like training, right? Why do we do training? My training wasn't measurable. We just did it. Not true companies, train people, so they either retain them or they can reduce costs because they're more knowledgeable.</p>

<p>So talk about the business impact conducted compliance training for a hundred plus managers virtually across five locations that reduce company costs by 50%. There you go. Why do we do training to save money? And we. And you show how you did it again, a meaningful conversation. How about saving money?</p>

<p>Right in, in business, we're saving money or making money at the end of the day. So implemented a new payroll and tax accounting system that saved the firm $2 million in costs over five years. If I'm applying to be in a finance department, that is core. If I'm applying to be in a procurement department that is critical.</p>

<p>So here's some examples of how you could talk AR how you could articulate your achievements in an empirical way. All right, we've built a tool to help you do this again the, the semantics you can play with, but sometimes we just need a little bit of a boost to figure out how to do it. So as part of the teal platform, you get what we call the resume builder.</p>

<p>It's really more focused on your achievement builder because formatting. And the way you wanna present your resume is really something that is highly personalized. So at the moment, we don't have technology to do that, but we really want you to document all your achievements in one place as exhaustively as possible.</p>

<p>So we've built a tool that we call the resume builder or the master resume. And let me go ahead and show you how it works. If you go over to the teal platform and look in the tools, you will see the master resume. You can either search for it, or you can go right to the page. It also happens to be in the picker.</p>

<p>So if you click over here and see resume builder, that'll take you over to your resume builder. And here we're using our resident teal member, Tina Miller.  as her profile to see, but you can see she's built out all her achievements. And again, this isn't gonna be what she use. To apply to jobs. It is her career archive and her log of all of her successes.</p>

<p>And you can start to build them out. So you click here and add a roll. You can just type it out. You can copy and paste it from your resume, but really what we're trying to add value with here is this achievement assistant. So if you click this here, we can use a little wizard to help us construct these achievement statements.</p>

<p>So we'll start by picking the category and this is a metric improve.  so what did you do? So these are these success verbs we talked about. All right. And we're gonna give you a list to pick from you can use your own, but these are a bunch to get you started so improved. All right. And what did I improve?</p>

<p>So given that Tina Miller's a marketer, she improved revenue right now. What was the metric? And by when did you do it? So did it buy that gives me that nice little simple percentage that I can just change here. Let's say 150%. And how long did I do it? It's important that you give it that time. So did it in six months.</p>

<p>Let's just go ahead and fix that then. Connected to the action and the strategy. So what was the outcome? So what did I do? How did I do it? So I did it by and here it's by BLE mending a feral platform. And so here you go, improved revenue by 150% and six months by implementing a referral. I'll add that achievement.</p>

<p>And there it is on my master resume. Again, this isn't formatted to the document, but you start to build these out and think of every achievement you've had here. You can be incredibly exhaustive cuz later in another class, we're gonna talk about how you're gonna want to pick specific achievements that are relative to a job.</p>

<p>So here you wanna be as exhaustive as possible and write. All the achievements that you've done. And if it's a little redundant or if it was a little, duplicative that's okay here. Cause what you're gonna do is you're gonna edit these down later on a job by job basis. All right. So that's the master resume tool that we've got there to help you build your achievements and to push you along with a format.</p>

<p>But again, feel free to change these there's other formats that you can use online. But the main thing is to think about those action, positive verbs, those things that you affected and what the outcome.  in this section, we're gonna talk about LinkedIn. LinkedIn, love it. Or hate it is one of the most powerful career management.</p>

<p>Everybody is on there. They have hundreds of millions of people, and it is absolutely paramount to managing your career that you be on LinkedIn. So we're gonna talk about the best ways to manage your LinkedIn cuz we see it as one of the ways to manage your online identity and create inbound. You want a machine that's just out there always generating inbound in people coming to you. Cause those are the best kind of career opportunities. So let's go ahead and talk about how to do that. So LinkedIn is your virtual billboard to the. Is a massive platform. Recruiters use it extensively on how to find.</p>

<p>And what we talk about is it's one of the best ways to be found if you're not familiar with the term S E O it's search engine optimization, and it's oftentimes referred to Google and different search engines, but at the end of the day, linked in as a search engine for people. And there are a lot of people looking to hire looking to acquire talent on LinkedIn and how do they.</p>

<p>They search. They either search directly in LinkedIn or they use a tool called LinkedIn recruiter that specifically build to find talent. And so it's your job to optimize your profile. So you get found, and the way, how do you get found through words, people put in words. And so if your. LinkedIn profile is sparse and not descriptive of who you are when someone searches for a particular ability or title, you're not gonna show up.</p>

<p>And so that's really what you wanna do. You wanna make sure that you're showing up and we think of LinkedIn as a wonderful inbound tool. You want hiring managers, you want recruiters, you want CEOs, you want investors finding. When they search for people. And now there's a whole another level of engagement in content production, but we're gonna focus on your profile and making sure that your profile has all the things it needs to really stand out.</p>

<p>So the anatomy of a LinkedIn profile, we're not gonna go deep on every single little section, but we're gonna talk about the key areas that you need to focus on the header the about, and the experience. All right. You wanna make sure that those are tailored right? And. You can focus on the other areas, but if you only got time to focus on these three, it's really important that you do it.</p>

<p>So the header the header is the most important part of your LinkedIn page without a doubt, a hundred percent of the people that go to your LinkedIn page will see the header. You cannot say that for the rest of your LinkedIn, because they have to require they have to scroll it's called above the fold, right?</p>

<p>When the page loads, they will see the header, all the parts below. They have to scroll and some percentage less than a hundred will not go down. They will leave right there. So this is where you really have to hook people with your header. And so let's talk about a few key components here. The banner visually catches people.</p>

<p>It's a time for you to say something about yourself without needing to use words. And so be mindful of it not being too busy too distracting and not really being too polarizing, but have it reveal a layer about you. And it shows that you care and that you've taken the time to to customize your profile.</p>

<p>Next would be your headshot. You'd be surprised how many people either don't put a headshot or just put in some random headshot. Remember that LinkedIn is a professional network and people are very quickly making judgements on whether to hire you. Very fast, right? Recruiters are skimming spending seconds on a page.</p>

<p>So convey your best professional self. Be mindful. If you don't have a professional headshot, you can make one yourself with a mobile phone. They're getting incredibly good. Just set it up, or, look for a photo that you've done in the past where you're dressed professionally and you look professional.</p>

<p>Don't use one of like you in a crowd of people where I can't tell if it's you or somebody else be mindful of it. It's important. Put your best foot. Next is your name? Think about how people would look for you, in this case, I like to say if Christina, if Tina's full name was Christina. She may in parentheses put Christina and then have Tina Miller.</p>

<p>Think about the ways that people might search for you. So if you've got a maiden name and people know you by that name, put it in parentheses because otherwise there's no way the system's gonna know. So think about findability with your name when people search for you by name that any combination can be there.</p>

<p>Then your headline is by far one of the most important, and by default it uses your title and the company that you were at last or currently. And that's not enough, right? Because it's really your opportunity to project the title that you want. Now, you don't wanna flat out lie, but it is heavily valued.</p>

<p>In the search engine and when people are seeing search results, it's one of the things that shows up. So aspiring VP or future marketing director. You can do things like that, but be mindful of the language. Don't do things like. Hire like looking to be hired or open to work because people don't search for those terms.</p>

<p>There are other ways in LinkedIn recruiter that they can do that by just checking a box if you have that on. So use that as an opportunity to put in words that people would be looking for title ability company. Have those in there and then location, right now there is clearly an upward trend in remote work and your ability to be anywhere, but we still tend to hire geographically.</p>

<p>So be mindful about how you use your geography. We generally recommend that specificity is better, cause as an example, if someone just said greater New York area, if my location was Brooklyn, I'd show up. And if someone searched for Brooklyn, I'd still show up. So specificity is good, cuz there's a way for it to get caught in the broader search terms.</p>
