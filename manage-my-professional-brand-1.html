<p>In this class, we're gonna talk about how to manage your professional brand. And that's going to really help you think about how you put your identity out in the world and how it grows your career. The agenda for this class is gonna cover a little bit of our approach and how we think about it and Tealâ€™s way.</p>

<p>And then we're gonna talk about achievements. At the end of the day are the proof that you've got abilities and we feel strongly that abilities are the currency of careers. We get hired for our abilities. And achievements is how we prove we've got those abilities. Then there's your blurb.</p>

<p>Your blurb is your pitch. What is your concise way of talking about who you are and what you want to do then LinkedIn, probably the most powerful career building tool out there and talking about how to manage that online presence. And then we'll wrap up with a summary on how we think about managing your brand more broadly and maybe some of the other things you can do outside of teal.</p>

<p>So with that, let's go ahead and get started. In this section, we're gonna talk about Teal's approach to building and managing your personal brand. And the way we define personal brand is it's the perception of an individual based on their experience skills and achievement within a career field, or industry.</p>

<p>And this is your brand. Think about brands like comp the way companies have brands, right? It's what people say about us when we're not there, that person was great to work with. That person builds great teams. That person is highly operational. That person's a great ideas person.  and they've done a lot.</p>

<p>And so that's what we wanna start to think about. And it doesn't happen automatically. It happens by what we put out there and we can take an active role in shaping that brand. And when it comes to your career and your identity and how people talk about you, it's really important that you be proactive in your approach to doing that.</p>

<p>And core to that is how you see yourself.  and then how others see you, that intersection of those two things is your personal brand and the closer you can bring them together, the better, right? What are people saying about you out in the market? How are people sharing the content you're producing? How are people passing along your resume?</p>

<p>How are people making introductions? That is all part of your personal brand. And we really want to focus on the way you curate that and that you get the most out. And so we see there being three core components that we're gonna cover in this class on how to curate and manage your personal brand. It's your achievements and the things you've done and how you articulate them in a way that provide proof that you've done them.</p>

<p>Then your pitch, your blurb, right? Oftentimes when you're gonna ask for an introduction or make a reference or a referral, it's what people are gonna see. It's your elevator pitch for yourself. And that shows up in your LinkedIn, it shows up in your resume. It shows up when you email it to somebody. So we really wanna get that tight.</p>

<p>And then your LinkedIn profile, like we said, is one of the most important things in building out your personal brand and your career identity. So we're gonna go deep on some of the things that you should think about as you're building out your LinkedIn profile. So with that, we'll jump into the next section.</p>

<p>In this section, we're gonna talk about achievements and achievements are proof that you've got an. And abilities are the currency of careers. At the end of the day, we get hired for our abilities, maybe who we know got us there, but what we know keeps us there. So it's really important that we focus on achievements and we continually document them in the way that prove what we know how to do.</p>

<p>So let's go ahead and dive in. An achievement is empirical proof that shows you have an ability. Again, it's really important that we think about that. It's empirical proof that shows you have an ability, right? Cause oftentimes it's your word against there. So you need to make a convincing case that you know how to do these things that you are saying, how to do, and achievements are the way to do that.</p>

<p>Most people forget to re include results in their LinkedIn profile and their career materials. Resumes oftentimes are very descriptive or done in narrative form and we need the results. We need to show the impact of our work. On the business. How did the company grow? How did the company prosper?</p>

<p>How did the company do better as a result of the work that we did, and we need to show that empirically. And so it's really important that we think about the results. And a lot of times we'll hear people say the work I did, wasn't measurable. Everything is measurable. Now that said not everything needs to be talked about in a measurable way, but everything's measurable.</p>

<p>And even. The act of showing that you were able to talk about it in empirical ways helps you stand out from the crowd. Cuz most people will just default to saying, ah, it's not measurable and then they won't do it, but it can be done. And it shows that you think in a business centric way when you're able to do it, here's an example of what not to do and what you'll see oftentimes on resumes or when people describe their work, worked with the tech team to increase web traffic.</p>

<p>Okay. What was your involvement in it? What did you do? How much did you increase it? Was it nominal? Was it pretty big? And it just doesn't say much in it. It just a lazy way to talk about it where it's just not gonna work. No, one's gonna believe you did it. Anyone can say this it's incredibly generic.</p>

<p>Now, what if you include measurable metrics and you talk about the results, so you can talk about the value that you brought to the business. So something like that could say grew engagement by 200%, which led to double the revenue in three months. Okay. I wanna hire that person. That is a person that knows how to think about engagement.</p>

<p>They know what part of the website traffic mattered. And they had a clear understanding of what the outcome was to the business and what they were working towards. This person lines up goals, achieves them and can talk about them in an empirical way and their impact to the business. That's what we're talking about.</p>

<p>When we talk about achievements and proof that you've done this and that you've got these abilities, this person knows how to manage engagement. This person knows how to think about revenue. This person helps the business do better. Therefore, I want them in the company and they're gonna grow within this company.</p>

<p>And there's a simple formula. There's a lot of different formats out there. And you don't need to stick semantically too, purely to this formula, but the idea is that you want that success verb. You don't want just generic verbs that don't say anything like managed or was part of, what did you do?</p>

<p>You increased it, you grew it, you reduced expenses. What was that active success verb then? What was the thing? The noun that you affect?  what was the metric that you were measuring and then what was that outcome? And you wanna make sure that you include these in your achievements. So what that could look like when we go back to the achievement that we used before grew, that's our success verb engagement.</p>

<p>That's what we were working on. The what? Buy metric 200%. That's substantial. Now you wanna be thoughtful about your metrics. We'll talk about that in a little bit, but you can frame metrics in a different way. So going from one to three is 200% grew up by two. Not that impressive. So you wanna be thoughtful in your storytelling and how you use the right metrics that paint the best light, which then led to double the revenue in three months, right?</p>

<p>That's the outcome that's impress. What was the outcome and in what time it wasn't indefinite. I read this and I say, okay, this person understood what they were doing. This is a clear and concise achievement. This feels to me like they really did this. This gives me proof that they did this. This gives me confidence to hire this.</p>
